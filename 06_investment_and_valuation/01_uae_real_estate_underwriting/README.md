# UAE Real Estate Underwriting

## Investment Question
Does a UAE-based real estate asset generate acceptable risk-adjusted returns under realistic market assumptions?

## Decision Use
Supports investment screening and underwriting decisions for UAE residential and mixed-use assets by:
- evaluating sustainable cash flow (NOI)
- assessing leverage and coverage risk (DSCR)
- comparing returns across base, upside, and downside scenarios

## Methodology
- Net Operating Income (NOI) modeling
- Operating expense assumptions aligned with UAE market norms
- Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)
- Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
- Sensitivity analysis on rent, vacancy, financing terms, and exit cap rate

## UAE-Specific Considerations
- Rent dynamics and renewal behavior
- Service charges and maintenance costs
- Financing structure and loan terms
- Exit liquidity and cap rate sensitivity

## Risk Assessment
- Occupancy and demand risk
- Interest rate and refinancing risk
- Exit valuation risk

## Outputs
- Pro forma cash flow
- Return metrics (IRR, equity multiple)
- Coverage ratios (DSCR)

## Tools
Excel

## Status
Framework documented. Model implementation planned using simulated UAE market data.
