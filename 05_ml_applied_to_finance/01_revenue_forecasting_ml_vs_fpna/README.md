# Revenue Forecasting: ML vs FP&A

## Business Question
When does machine learning improve revenue forecasting accuracy compared to traditional FP&A approaches?

## Decision Use
Supports finance leaders in deciding:
- whether ML-based forecasts add value
- how to balance model accuracy with interpretability
- which forecasting approach to trust for planning

## Approaches Compared
1. Traditional FP&A forecasting
   - Trend-based or driver-based models
   - Assumption-driven logic

2. Machine learning forecasting
   - Time-series or regression-based models
   - Pattern recognition from historical data

## Evaluation Criteria
- Forecast accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE)
- Stability across periods
- Ease of explanation to stakeholders

## Interpretation
Accuracy alone is not sufficient; forecasts must be explainable and actionable for planning.

## Tools
Python

## Status
Framework documented. Model comparison planned.
