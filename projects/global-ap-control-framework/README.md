# Global AP Control & Compliance Framework (Excel)

## Overview
The **Global AP Control & Compliance Framework** is a comprehensive **Accounts Payable (AP)** control model designed for **multi-country operations**. This project focuses on integrating key financial governance processes, including **validation rules**, **payment batch governance**, **EOR reconciliation**, and **donor/grant compliance monitoring**. The framework is particularly useful for **NGO organizations** like **ILGA**, and is adaptable for payroll systems like **Oyster**.

## Project Flow:
1. **Raw_Input**: Data input, which includes transactions and payroll records.
2. **Validation_Engine**: Data validation and error-checking processes to ensure accuracy and compliance.
3. **Payment_Batch**: Governance of the payment process to only allow approved transactions.
4. **EOR_Reconciliation**: Matching expected payroll with actual invoices to ensure accuracy.
5. **Grant_Register**: Tracking payments to grants, monitoring payment statuses, and ensuring proper reporting.
6. **Donor_Compliance_Summary**: Overview of donor compliance, ensuring that the funds are reported correctly.
7. **AP_Control_Dashboard**: Executive-level dashboard providing visibility into AP controls and risks.

## Key Modules:
- **Validation Engine**: Validates transactions based on compliance rules, blocks errors, and provides error reasons.
- **Payment Batch**: Only allows approved transactions to be processed.
- **EOR Reconciliation**: Matches payroll expectations with actual invoices for correct disbursements.
- **Grant Register**: Tracks payments and reporting statuses for grant management.
- **Donor Compliance Summary**: Checks compliance with donor regulations and tracks funding reporting.
