# Finance, Data, BI, ML & Investment Portfolio

This repository documents how I approach finance, analytics, and investment problems with a focus on decision-making, clarity, and validation.

The work here reflects how real finance and analytics teams operate: defining the business question first, structuring the logic carefully, validating assumptions, and communicating results clearly — especially in remote and async environments.

The portfolio covers:
- FP&A and driver-based financial planning
- Finance-focused data analytics and reporting automation
- Executive dashboards (Tableau / Power BI)
- Accounting controls and pricing analysis
- Applied machine learning for financial decision support
- Investment analysis and valuation (UAE-focused)

> Some projects are fully implemented, while others are documented as analytical or financial frameworks prior to full execution. This mirrors professional practice, where design and validation come before scaling.
