# Finance, Data, BI, ML & Investment Portfolio

I design finance and analytics frameworks that help organizations understand performance, forecast outcomes, and make high-quality decisions under uncertainty.

This repository documents how I approach real-world business problems across:
- FP&A and driver-based financial planning
- Finance-focused data analytics and automation
- Executive dashboards (Tableau / Power BI)
- Accounting controls and pricing systems
- Applied machine learning for financial decisions
- Investment analysis and valuation

The emphasis is not on tools alone, but on how models and frameworks are structured, validated, and used — particularly in fully remote and async environments.

> Some projects are fully implemented, while others are documented as framework designs or partial implementations using simulated or anonymized data. This reflects how professional finance and analytics teams plan before execution.
